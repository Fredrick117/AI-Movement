## Game AI Behavior Simulation
A project I created for a Game AI class to learn about AI behaviors and movement. Made with [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).

## Background
This simulation can illustrate each of the following movement behaviors:
- Seek (a boid moves towards the target location, but does not stop when it reaches the location)
- Arrive (a boid moves towards the target location, slowing its velocity as it approaches the destination and eventually stopping)
- Wander (a boid moves around the world in a random fashion)
- Flock (a group of boids move together, like a flock of birds)

*The flock leader is represented in red, while the followers are represented in white. The flock leader is set to "wander", while the followers are actively "seeking" the leader*
